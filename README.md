# Steps to run the code :- 

1. Firstly, run the jupyter notebook using the `jupyter notebook` and then it will generate feature set and trained model as they are very big so couldn't  upload here. It would have saved lots of time but I can't help.

2. After that you just have to run a python script with test file and output file as script parameters & putting all the files in same directory. It will happily produce the desired output.

`python3 LoanDefaultPrediction.py /test_file_path /output_file_path`
